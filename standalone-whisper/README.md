# MVP-Echo Standalone Whisper

**Isolated Build Environment for Faster-Whisper Executable**

This folder contains everything needed to build a standalone `whisper-standalone.exe` that requires **zero Python dependencies**. This executable is then integrated into the main MVP-Echo application.

## 🎯 Purpose

Creates a trustworthy, self-contained Faster-Whisper executable that:
- Works immediately without Python installation
- Uses the same CTranslate2 technology as the Python upgrade path  
- Provides native performance with GPU support
- Auto-downloads models on first use
- Maintains complete independence from main app code

## 📁 Structure

```
standalone-whisper/           # ← This isolated folder
├── README.md                # ← This file
├── whisper-cli.py          # Python CLI script
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── build.ps1              # PyInstaller build script
├── dist/                  # Build output
│   └── whisper-standalone.exe  # Final executable
└── build/                 # Build artifacts (temp)
```

## 🏗️ Build Process

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Internet connection (for dependencies and models)

### Build Commands

```powershell
# Navigate to this folder
cd standalone-whisper

# Build the executable
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1

# Test the executable (optional)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1 -Test

# Clean build artifacts
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1 -Clean
```

### Build Output
- **Executable**: `dist/whisper-standalone.exe` (~100-150MB)
- **Ready for**: Integration into MVP-Echo packaging

## 🧪 Testing Standalone

The executable works completely independently:

```powershell
# Basic transcription
.\dist\whisper-standalone.exe audio.wav

# With options
.\dist\whisper-standalone.exe audio.mp3 --model base --language en --gpu

# JSON output  
.\dist\whisper-standalone.exe audio.wav --json

# Quiet mode
.\dist\whisper-standalone.exe audio.wav --quiet
```

## 🔗 Integration with MVP-Echo

After building, the executable integrates into the main app:

```powershell
# Copy to main app (done automatically by main build process)
copy dist\whisper-standalone.exe ..\whisper-bin\

# Main app can now use the executable
cd ..
npm run pack
```

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Complete Isolation**: This folder contains everything needed for the executable
2. **No Main App Dependencies**: Can build and test without the Electron app
3. **Trusted Provenance**: We build everything ourselves from known sources
4. **Same Technology**: Uses Faster-Whisper (same as Python upgrade path)
5. **Production Ready**: Optimized, versioned, and tested executable

## 🚀 Performance

- **CPU**: 1x baseline speed
- **GPU**: 5-10x faster with CUDA
- **Models**: Auto-download tiny (39MB), base (74MB), small (244MB)
- **Memory**: ~500MB RAM usage
- **Startup**: <2 seconds after model cached

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- **Python not found**: Install Python 3.8+
- **Dependencies fail**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` manually
- **PyInstaller fails**: Update with `pip install --upgrade pyinstaller`

### Runtime Issues  
- **GPU not detected**: Install NVIDIA drivers / CUDA toolkit
- **Model download fails**: Check internet connection
- **Audio format error**: Convert to WAV/MP3 format first
